## Abstract

This paper studies how electoral systems impact public spending. Political economy contributes an important dimension to this debate: theory predicts different compositions of public spending under different electoral systems. This paper analyses the public spending data of US local governments from 1944â€“1977 to assess this prediction empirically. In this period, several local governments adopted a proportional electoral system before reverting to a pluralist one. I exploit the variation across cities and time that this natural experiment creates to analyse the effect of each electoral system on public spending. My findings support the prediction that electoral systems affect public spending.
